    <h1>WAC - Guideline for submission</h1>

    <h2>tl;dr</h2>

    <p>
        The format of your paper (Technical papers, Demo / Poster or Web Audio Gig) must be compliant with <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/pubform.doc">this Word template</a> you can directly fill and <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wac15">submit</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>In details</h2>

    <p>
        Since many of you might not be used to academic paper publishing, we decided to write this guideline explaining what you need to do.
        <br>
        You can think of the technical paper for a library presentation as a detailed README page, or for a web app presentation as an explanation on how you built it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's – roughly – the structure you should follow:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Abstract - overview of your paper subject (name of the library, goals - 4 to 8 lines)
        </li>
        <li>
            some Categories and Subject Descriptors - you can find the appropriate ones <a href="http://www.acm.org/class/1998/">here</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            General Terms - one or more (provided in the template below)
        </li>
        <li>
            an Introduction with a short summary of your library or web app - and the problematic it tries to solve or its innovative aspect in term of user experience
        </li>
        <li>
            an in detail project description: as many paragraphs, schemes, screenshots as needed in which you explain
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What already existed (equivalent libraries or web app, native app or desktop ones) ?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What was your specific needs ?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is new with your approach, and why this approach fits your needs ?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How did you use web standards (especially Web Audio API)
                </li>
                <li>
                    How or did you improve your web app or library based on user feedback ?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Conclusion, and future plans, possible improvements or new app ideas
        </li>
        <li>
            References: link to GitHub pages, online demo ...
        </li>
        <li>
            Upload your paper to <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wac15">WAC submission website</a>
        </li>
