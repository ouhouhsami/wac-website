          <div>
            <p>
              The web has supported multiple media since its inception - however, only
              recently has it become a viable platform for building audio applications.
              The talk will examine the journey of audio in the web platform, the
              intersection of interesting technologies that make this a pivotal point for
              audio and the web, and will highlight the opportunities unlocked by web
              audio and where we go from here.
            <br />
              Chris Wilson is a Developer Advocate on the Google Chrome team.  He started
              working on web browsers in 1993 when he co-authored the original Windows
              version of NCSA Mosaic before working on Internet Explorer for fifteen
              years at Microsoft.  He has separate and combined passions for digital
              audio, music and the web, and co-edits the Web Audio and Web MIDI
              specifications at the W3C.  He also specializes in playing many different
              instruments badly.

          <div>
            <p>
              The introduction of the Web Audio API has enriched the web landscape enormously. It gives game developers the ability to add precisely timed, high performant sound effects and to create realistic spatialized sound landscapes.
            <br />
              For many web developers it is the first time they encounter audio programming which leads to many interesting experiments when the world of web and audio collide. Traditional web developers start to become really interested in audio programming and educate themselves on the topic of synthesizers and audio effects.
            <br />
              However, currently there are only few applications that try to create more sophisticates audio production tools in the browser. In this talk I want to show how I used the Web Audio API and other emerging web standards like WebRTC to create a collaborative digital audio workstation. It allows users to record, arrange and create their own songs in collaboration with other users in real time.

            <p>
              A large collection of Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) plugins is available on the Internet in open source form. This paper explores their reuse in browser environments, focusing on hosting options that do not require manual installation. Two options based on Emscripten and PNaCl are introduced, implemented, evaluated, and released as open source. We found that ported DAW effect and sound synthesizer plugins complement and integrate with the Web Audio API, and that the existing preset patch collections make the plugins readily usable in online contexts. The latency measures are higher than in native plugin implementations, but expected to reduce with the emerging AudioWorker node.

              There are many existing native libraries and frameworks for audio feature extraction used in multimedia information retrieval. Many are dependent on highly optimised low level code to cope with the high performance requirements of realtime audio analysis. In this paper, we present a new audio feature extractor library, Meyda, for use with the JavaScript Web Audio API, and detail its benchmarking results. Meyda provides the first library for audio feature extraction in the web client, which will enable music information retrieval systems, complex visualisations and a wide variety of technologies and creative projects that previously were relegated to native software. The Meyda project, including source code and documentation is released under an MIT license.

              As technologies evolve and mature, proper tooling is needed to increase adoption and combat complexity. Web audio is no exception.
            <br />
              An overture on the state of web audio tools, we will explore using both browser developer tools that take advantage of privileged platform code, and cross-browser drop-in libraries to provide introspection of the state of an audio context and nodes. With these tools, we’ll cover common debugging scenarios like audio graph construction, node-to-node signal transformations, signal visualizations, garbage collection, and resource consumption. These tools can help beginners understand a complex new API, save a developer’s time debugging, and help browser implementers optimize their platform.
              Attendees will leave with the knowledge of what tools are out there, workflows for inspecting, fixing, and optimizing a web audio environment, and how to make their own tools for a specific use case.

          <div>
            <p>
              At Sonoport, we ported our Dynamic Sound Engine from Adobe's Flash technology to Web Audio API. The difference in approaches to threading, scheduling, and parameters between Flash and Web Audio API created a few challenges for us. These differences and some peculiarities of the Web Audio API required workarounds to be able to implement our Dynamic Sound Engine in Web Audio API. In this paper we discuss three of these workarounds dealing with creating parameters, scheduling operations, and playback position of buffers, and explain how these work-arounds, although not optimal solutions, allowed us to support our use cases. Finally, we consider how the upcoming AudioWorker change in the Web Audio API specification is expected to impact these workarounds.

              In this article we present an API and a set of JavaScript modules for the synchronized scheduling and aligned playback of predetermined sequences of events such as notes, audio segments, and parameter changes as well as media streams (e.g. audio buffers) based on the Web Audio API logical time.
            <br />
              The API has been designed to facilitate the development on both ends, the implementation of modules which generate event sequences or media streams as well as the integration of such modules into complex audio applications that require flexible scheduling, playback and synchronization.

            <p>
              The audio programming world is extremely prolific in domain-specific languages.
              Programmers and musicians prefer a custom-tailored environment where their high-level ideas can be better expressed and implemented thanks to specific domain knowledge.
            <br />
              In particular, strongly typed functional programming has become an ideal platform for audio programming, thanks to a concise, high-level writing style, high reusability, and ability to avoid mistakes and improve error handling.
            <br />
              - How may Web Audio benefit from these ideas?
            <br />
              - How may such languages benefit from Web Audio?
            <br />
              In this talk, we will use the functional audio programming language Faust as the reference DSL, to discuss a formal theory of interoperable and efficient audio components. Particular emphasis will be made on the use of strong, functional-style type-systems.
            <br />
              We will address performance, security, and practical considerations, and reflect on the relationship of such theoretical framework to the actual standard.

              This paper discusses the presence of the sound and music computing system Csound in the modern world-wide web browser platform. It introduces the two versions of the system currently available, as pure Javascript code, and as portable Native Client binary module with a Javascript interface. Three example applications are presented, showing some of the potential uses of the system. The paper concludes with a discussion of the wider Csound application ecosystem, and the prospects for its future development.

              Braid (Browser Audio Interface and Database) is a web audio instrument-building environment developed with the NexusUI platform. To identify the requirements of such an environment, the utility of NexusUI as an audio interface engine for web browser-based projects is reviewed. The addition of inline web audio within a drag-and-drop interface-building environment is discussed. A consideration of a modified Model-View-Controller architecture to integrate DSP code and interface is followed by an examination of the workflow of designing browser-based instruments within Braid. Finally, a database for saving and sharing web audio instruments for performance or audience distribution is described.

              Presentation of an application that demonstrates object-based 3D audio rendering in the web browser using the Web Audio API. The application loads audio files containing object-based meta-data and provides head-tracked dynamic binaural rendering of the content to create an immersive 3D audio experience for headphone listeners. The user can interact with the rendering by muting individual audio objects and switching between the binaural rendering mode and conventional stereo rendering.
              The demo also includes visualisations of the object-based meta-data. Active objects are highlights on a 2D timeline visualisation and THREE.js is used to show the rendering location of each audio source in 3D space.
            <br />
              This application demonstrates a future of broadcast sound experiences over the web, where immersive content is rendered on the client and can be adapted to listener context, as page layout is adapted to device context today with responsive design.

              Listening tests are widely used to assess the quality of audio systems. The majority of such listening tests are conducted in controlled environments with selected participants and professional audio equipment. In the last few years, conducting listening tests over the Internet, as so called web-based experiments, has become popular. A recent study has shown that web-based experiments lead to comparable results as laboratory experiments.
            <br />
              Until now, it was only possible to implement a limited number of listening test types as web-based experiments because web standards were missing some crucial features (e.g. sample manipulation of audio streams). With the upcoming of the Web Audio API, a much wider range of listening test types can be implemented as new audio processing features have been introduced. This talk will demonstrate which new possibilities are enabled by the Web Audio API. To this end, the ITU-R Recommendation BS.1534 (MUSHRA) is taken as an example.

              Large multi-channel spatial audio systems have historically been a playground for universities and well-funded studios, but only a dream for independent composers.
            <br />
              Similarly, "parallel computers" were locked in research facilities where only a few musicians ever gained access to the computational power to convolve hundreds of separate audio streams with spatially specific room impulse responses. Mobile devices in the hands of audiences can quickly configure themselves into these kinds of systems at very affordable (and distributed) cost and little effort, making powerful and expressive spatially distributed musical platforms accessible to anyone today. We describe some software systems and artistic works that have been recently developed to explore some of the spatial audio capabilities of the mobile device browser platform.

              This study considers the issue of providing an individual listening experience for binaural sound reproduction in web browsers via headphones. The proposed solution aims at building a web framework with Web Audio API, giving support to the download of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) associated with listener's personal profile from a server and the synchronization between the listener's devices. With each playback device and listener, the individual headphone equalization filters will be computed from headphone transfer functions (HpTFs) stored on the server. At server side, we propose to store the HRTFs and HpTFs in spatially oriented format for acoustics (SOFA). At client-side, we propose to convert the data to a new structure (WAV) ensuring a compatible solution with existing Web Audio API implementations. A binaural rendering implementation in JavaScript acting as a proof-of-concept reveals critical issues related to the native implementation in web browsers.

              Audio is one of the domains where developers try to get every bit of

              looks like an high-level API with a lot of constraints for developers.
              What does the web platform need for the Web Audio API to be competitive
              with native audio? What problems does the platform have that can be
              solved today?

            <p>
              Audio is often placed on the Internet without much thought about how it can be found, searched, shared, navigated and generally deconstructed.
              Hyperaudio weaves audio into the very fabric of the web. By transcribing the spoken parts of audio and assigning timings to each an every word we allow people to navigate, search and share in naturally and accurately manner. Uniquely Hyperaudio allows people to intuitively edit audiovisual content from its transcript.
              Editing media content with Hyperaudio is as easy as editing a text document.
            <br />
              The Hyperaud.io service allows people to link, to transcribe and align media, and then remix it with the Hyperaudio Pad - augmenting excerpts of audio and video with effects and music.
              We're currently working with libraries and schools and using Hyperaudio to foster media literacy in a new generation.
              In order to create hyperaud.io we built an API, a series of decoupled tools and our MIT licensed JavaScript Library - Hyperaudio.js - which anyone can use to open up their audio.

            <p>
              This presentation and live audio demonstration explores the capabilities of using the Web Audio API as a digital audio workstation (DAW) to manipulate sounds from massive server-side databases. Sonic source material comes from a database of birdsongs recorded worldwide by volunteer recordists at xeno-canto.org. Sounds from xeno-canto are chosen to match recent, nearby bird sightings submitted by volunteer birders at eBird. The result is a virtual soundscape derived from the sounds of birds currently present in the user’s physical environment.
            <br />
              Our software delegates database queries and archival storage to the server, leaving the client to concentrate on the aesthetic context of sound modification and manipulation. Engineering issues include separation of client versus server concerns and mashups of crowdsourced databases. Aesthetic issues include which tasks are automated server-side, which are user-controlled client-side, and why. Social issues include single user versus multiple user paradigms, artistic soundscape composition versus commercial applications (e.g., games with evolving sound tracks) using public domain sound sources, music as foreground art versus background audio content, and the larger role of sound and music in current society. Audio results will be demonstrated as each topic is addressed.

              VenueExplorer is a new approach to broadcasting live events which gives more control to the audience than traditional viewing methods. Users can navigate around an ultra-high resolution video, zooming into the areas of the event which interest them and accessing extra content. VenueExplorer aims to be platform independent and runs in the browser. In this paper we describe the development of object-based audio rendering to create a more engaging and personalised experience than that of video alone. We use the Web Audio API to process audio based on the users viewport. We also describe a library that has been developed as part of this project for the handling of location based audio objects.

            <p>Noteflight is a web application and vibrant online community that supports the creation, sharing and playback of scores using conventional Western music notation, all taking place within a standard web browser. The site has been live for 6 years and has over 1.2 million registered users today. Of necessity, Noteflight was launched using the Adobe Flash platform, but in the last several years it has successfully transitioned to a pure Web standards environment including SVG and Web Audio.            <br />
              Prior to Noteflight, interactive notation editing was only available via a small number of native desktop applications. This state of affairs kept composers, arrangers and musicians from participating in the revolution in communication that has so changed human affairs in recent decades. Today, Noteflight provides a planetary-scale community for musical creation, consumption and education that is both free and standards-based.
            <br />
              The most musically significant and innovative features of Noteflight include the notation editor and its built-in sequencer, synthesizer and mixer that use downloadable instrument samples. This talk will discuss significant implementation challenges for these components, and look at how they differ from analogous components in the native-app arena. Particular attention will be given to how being a networked, community-based application affected many design goals. Along the way, the talk will also shed light on the challenges facing Noteflight's transition from a proprietary platform (Flash) to a pure web-standards platform.

              Technologies for discovering sounds in large databases can help blurring the boundary between exploration and music performance. In this paper, we present a system for exploring loops from Freesound.org. Sound files are grouped by their most common repetition periods, so that they can be played in sync. A graph layout algorithm is used to organize sounds in a two-dimensional plane so that loops with similar timbre are spatially close. The result is a system that can be used as a musical instrument: since sounds will always play in sync, the user can freely explore the variety of sounds uploaded by the Freesound community, while continuously producing a rhythmic musical stream.

          <div>
Traversal is a series of performances for physical instruments, collaborators in virtual space, and computer mediator.  This performance emphasizes a collaborative performance by the audience on web enabled devices.  The interface and interactions are a series of spaces that connect audience members with each other and in doing so, create sonic events in the space and on the user's device.  Interactions include touching other audience participants through the virtual space, passing sound events from one user to another, and playing individual musical ideas that weave together into a sonic tapestry across the audience.

          <div>
          The Drops collective smartphone performance is strongly inspired by the mobile application Bloom by Brian Eno and and Peter Chilvers. Drops reproduces several audiovisual elements of the original Bloom application while transposing them into a collaborative experience.
          <br />
          In Drops, each participant can only play a single sound (i.e. a single pitch), whose timbre can vary depending on the touch position. Together, the players can construct sound sequences (i.e. melodies) by combining their sounds. The sounds are repeated in a fading loop every few seconds until they vanish. Players can clear the loop by shaking their smartphones. The sounds triggered by one player are automatically echoed by the smartphones of other players. The collective performance on the smartphones is accompanied by a synchronized soundscape on ambient loudspeakers.

          <div>
            This piece is produced live by interaction between a laptop connected to the
smartphones of the audience. Simultaneously up to 16 people can join the
interaction. <br />
The first part is made of many simple decaying tones and the audience can fluctuate
the frequencies and the depth of reverb by touching their smartphones. The second
part they can modulate the degree of distortion and the panning position of a slowly
waving cluster of tones by tilting and moving the smartphones around.
The third (last) part has nothing until each of audience touches his/her smartphone.
Every time each person touches, a tone is generated, and gradually changes according
to how many times they touch. <br />
The system configuration is similar to one explained in
<a href="http://www.jssa.info/paper/2013v05n03/PDF/3.Kita.pdf">http://www.jssa.info/paper/2013v05n03/PDF/3.Kita.pdf</a> (in Japanese). Similarly
configured pieces were played at 2nd International Csound Conference (
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J12iOcZkI6I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J12iOcZkI6I</a> ). This time client-side audio processing
by HTML5 Web Audio API is added to enhance feedback to each participant. The files
to be used will be put at <a href="http://tkita.net/csound/wac2014/">http://tkita.net/csound/wac2014/</a> .

              A number of members of the W3C Web Audio Group will be present at the WAC conference. The Audio Working Group will give a short presentation on how the process works from the W3C perspective and will highlight some of the areas that the Web audio community could help in the effort to move the API to a W3C recommendation. The Audio Working Group will then present some of the more complex issues that it deals with for discussion and take questions and suggestions from attendees.
